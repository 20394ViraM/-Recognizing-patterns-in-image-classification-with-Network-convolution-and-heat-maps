# -Recognizing-patterns-in-image-classification-with-Network-convolution-and-heat-maps
This project includes studying pattern for image classification and pattern recognization using a convolution neural network and heatmaps on an image dataset. We used the LRP algorithm for studying layers in neural networks implemented in Python.
